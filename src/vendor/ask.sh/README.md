To use this library just source it from your bash script and call the API functions:

## Purpose

This library ask user predefined questions, remember results for the next time, allow to
conditionally expecute code blocks based on the answers.

What for? Well, I wrote it to be able to conditionally generate ~/.vim configs
with on/off features for various features.

## Examples

see `examples` directory for examples of usage

## API

### init FILE

you call `init` with path to the file that will store the results.
the results of the previous run will be loaded if the file already exists.

    init .config

### desc DESCRIPTION

you can also call it with heredoc:

    desc <<END
    some
    heredoc
    END
