    Vim plugin to dim inactive windows.

    Diminactive uses 2 methods for dimming: color column highlight, and syntax.

    A simple toggle is provided to **globally** cycle through those 2 methods and and 'off' state: `<plug>cycle(diminactive)`

    It is bound to `<leader>Td`.

    Diminactive does provide methods to manage it on a window or buffer level. See [documentation](http://github.com/blueyed/vim-diminactive).
