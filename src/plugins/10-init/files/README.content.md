### Installation ([top](#top))

Clone this repository into `~/.vim`.

The installation is already configured with my default choices, you can review the configuration by running `make reconfigure` or `make edit`.

Run `make install`

<a name="toc-configuration" />

### Configuration ([top](#top))

Your configuration choices are stored in `.config` file. You can edit it
directly or just run `make edit`.

You will be asked quesions during the install only if the config file doesn't
already contain the answer.

`make reconfigure` will ask all questions all over again, with your previous
choices used as defaults.

During the installation this `README.md` file is re-generated with just the
information relevant to current configuration chocies.

### Load order ([top](#top))

First the following scripts are sourced:

* vimrc
    * vimrc.plugins
        * local/vimrc.plugins
    * local/vimrc

Then, after plugins were loaded, the following scripts are sourced:

* after/plugin/after.vim
    * vimrc.bindings
        * local/vimrc.bindings
    * vimrc.after
        * local/vimrc.after

### Dotvim Plugings ([top](#top))

Each plugin can add content to files in the target vim directory by simply
having the corresponding files present in the `plugin/files` directory

E.g. if plugin foo has file `plugins/files/directory/files`, then this file's
content will be added to `~/.vim/directory/files`

Plugins found in the `plugins` subdirectory will be automatically loaded as
well.

To make sure each such files will be re-created appropriately upon each install
run, they have to be cleaned up.. `10-init/plugins/10-cleanup` plugin takes
care of the standard ones, if you need a new file, you need to clean it up
your self. place the cleanup code in a `00=-....` plugin directory to make sure it is called
before any other plugin tries to add content to it.

If a plugin has a `prompt.sh` file in the directory, its loading will be
conditioned on evaling this script.

If the script "fails" (i.e. non-zero exit code), then the plugin will not be loaded.

> IMPORTANT: The prompt script is evaled in the contenxt of the generator, so it has
> access to all the state and functions, e.g. it can run `ask...` functions, etc.

Note that prompt.sh should usually only ask simple question and return
true/false, if you want something more complex create an `install.sh` instead.

If a plugin has an `install.sh` file in the directory, it will be sourced.

The logic flow is as follows:

- check for `prompt.sh` and exit if it returns false
- copy files from `files` directory
- load all plugins in the `plugins` directory
- run `install.sh` if exists

#### plugin ordering

The plugins are loaded according to their sort order.

#### example file structure

- `plugins`
    - `simple_directory_plugin`
        - `files`
            - `file_to_copy`
    - `plugin with a prompt`
        - `files`
            - `some file`
        - `prompt.sh`
    - `plugin_with_install_script`
        - `files`
            - `file_to_copy`
        - `other_files`
            - `other_files_to_copy`
        - `install.sh`
        - `plugins`
            - `sub-plugin1`
              ...
