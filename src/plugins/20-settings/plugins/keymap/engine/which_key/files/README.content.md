    This plugin is the core of the discoverable key bindings of this setup.

    When you press `<leader>` or `<localleader` and wait a little, a menu will
    popup at the bottom of the screen to guide you through available key
    bindings.

    You should read the original docs.

    One additional mapping that I added is `<leader>sw`. if you press `<CR>`
    after that you will get a menu of all the root bindings.

    But you can also edit the suggested command line and get a list of mappings
    from any prefix. e.g. `<c-w>`, which you can't usually get throught
    `Which Key`, as there is no way to pass `<c-w>` as the next key press to
    the menu.
